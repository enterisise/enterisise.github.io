-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=the-bones-of-the-foot>The Bones Of The Foot<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-bones-of-the-foot>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/thebonesofthefoot-180421100102/95/the-bones-of-the-foot-14-638.jpg?cb=1524304911" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.stFjDU3SumYEQ0lAmPVw5QHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="The bones of the foot"><p><em>Source: slideshare.net</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Cool wallpaper can be a great way to add personality and style to your home.
